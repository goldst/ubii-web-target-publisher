# ubii-web-target-publisher â€“ Work in progress
Ubi-Interact target publisher for web browsers. The target publisher can be used to send tracked user pose data. This is a necessary step in physical embodiment scenarios, where users are represented virtually through a physical avatar.

## Usage
Ubii-web-target-publisher can be used either as a standalone demo or as a node module in Your own applications.

To receive the published targets, another Ubi-Interact component is required. [ubii-web-ik-force-computation](https://github.com/goldst/ubii-web-ik-force-computation) simplifies this process and processing tasks using abstractions similar to the ones in this module.

## Prerequisites
This project communicates with a [Ubi-Interact master node](https://github.com/SandroWeber/ubii-node-master). Even though some of the functionality can be tested without it, it is recommended to have one.

### Online Demo
The demo in this project is available at https://goldst.dev/ubii-web-target-publisher/dist/.

### Running the demo locally
After cloning, install, and run the project:
```bash
npm install
npm start
```
Your terminal will contain the demo URL, e.g. http://localhost:8080. Note that the command starts a development server which is not suitable for production environments.

### Using this project as a node module
To your existing node project, add the module:
```bash
npm i ubii-web-target-publisher
```

You can either initialize the publisher in HTML using the bundled version:
```html
<script src=".node_modules/ubii-web-target-publisher/dist/bundle.js"></script>

<script>
    new UbiiWebTargetPublisher.Publisher(options);
</script>
```

Or you can import it directly in your JavaScript/TypeScript project:
```js
import { Publisher } from 'ubii-web-target-publisher';

new Publisher(options);
```

For available options, see [PublisherOptions.ts](./src/PublisherOptions.ts).

That's it! Other than supplying the options, no further configuration is necessary. If you want to stop the publisher, just call `stop()` on the publisher object.

## Development status and contributing
This project is work in progress. Let me know if you have any issues! Currently I'm not taking code contributions, because it is part of an university project. I am planing to open it up in June.

<!-- TODO replace section once bachelors thesis is finished>

Don't expect me to update this project that much once it's done :upside_down_face: but your code and documentation contributions are warmly welcomed. Make sure to create an issue first if you want to work on something and let me know there.
